# KitPipe
A crappy little asset pipeline in Python for CSS/JS. Created for [WP-Librarian](https://github.com/kittsville/WP-Librarian) but also so I'd use Python more.

###Requirements
- Python 2.7.9: If you can get Slimit working on Python 3 then remove 'import from futures' from KPipe and you're good to go
- Slimit
- CSSMin
